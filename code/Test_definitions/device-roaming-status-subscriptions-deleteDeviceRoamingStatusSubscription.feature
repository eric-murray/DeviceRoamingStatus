# Happy path scenarios
##########################

  @roaming_status_subscriptions_01_delete_subscription_based_on_an_existing_subscription-id
  Scenario: Delete the subscription with subscriptionId equal to "id"
    Given the API consumer has an active subscription with "subscriptionId" equal to "id"
    When the request "deleteDeviceRoamingStatusSubscription" is sent
    And the path parameter "subscriptionId" is set to "id"
    Then the response status code is 202 or 204
    And the response header "x-correlator" has same value as the request header "x-correlator"
    And if the response property "$.status" is 204 then response body is not present
    And if the response property "$.status" is 202 then response body complies with the OAS schema at "#/components/schemas/SubscriptionAsync" and the response property "$.id" is equal to "id"

  @roaming_status_subscriptions_02_subscription_delete_event_validation
  Scenario: Receive notification for subscription-ended event on deletion
    Given a valid subscription for a device exists with "subscriptionId" equal to "id"
    And the subscription property "$.sink" is a valid callback URL
    When the request "deleteDeviceRoamingStatusSubscription" is sent
    And the path parameter "subscriptionId" is set to "id"
    And the response status code is 202 or 204
    Then a subscription termination event notification is sent to the callback URL
    And the notification body complies with the OAS schema at "#/components/schemas/EventSubscriptionEnded"
    And the notification property "$.type" is equal to "org.camaraproject.device-roaming-status-subscriptions.v0.subscription-ended"
    And the notification property "$.data.subscriptionId" is equal to "id"
    And the notification request property "$.data.terminationReason" is equal to "SUBSCRIPTION_DELETED"
