# device-status-roaming-subscriptions-retrieveDeviceRoamingStatusSubscription
Feature: Device Roaming Status Subscriptions API, vwip - Operation retrieveDeviceRoamingStatusSubscription

  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * List of device identifier types which are not supported, among: phoneNumber, networkAccessIdentifier, ipv4Address, ipv6Address
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * A device object whose roaming status is known by the network when connected.
  # * The known roaming status of the testing device
  # * A sink-url identified as "callbackUrl", which receives notifications
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in device-roaming-status-subscriptions.yaml

  Background: Common Device Roaming Status Subscriptions setup
    Given the resource "{apiroot}/device-roaming-status-subscriptions/vwip/subscriptions" as base-url
    And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
    And the header "x-correlator" complies with the schema at "#/components/schemas/XCorrelator"
